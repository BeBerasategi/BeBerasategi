<h1 align="center">Hi there! 👋</h1>

- 👨‍🔬👨‍💻 I’m finishing a double degree in Physics and Electronic Engineering.
- 🔭 I'm currently working on my two Bachelor's Degree Final Projects. One of them is about using alchemical transformations and molecular dynamics to compute solvation energies. The other one consists in building neural networks to classify handwritten mathematical symbols.
- 🌱 I’m learning how GitHub works.
